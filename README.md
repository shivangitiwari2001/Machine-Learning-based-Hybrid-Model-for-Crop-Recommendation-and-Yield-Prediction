# Machine-Learning-based-Hybrid-Model-for-Crop-Recommendation-and-Yield-Prediction
In the phase of growing global food demands, agriculture must evolve to address inefficiencies, unpredictable yields, and the necessity for sustainable practices. Traditional farming techniques often lack the precision needed to optimize resource use and forecast crop performance accurately. This research paper presents an innovative Machine Learning based Hybrid Model for Crop Recommendation and Yield Prediction which is crucial at the field level for quantitative and economic assessment for creating agriculture commodities plan for crop production, import-export strategies and enhancing farmers income. This model is combination of two different models, the first one is Crop Recommendation System consist of extensive datasets on soil properties and weather conditions trained with different ML algorithm giving accuracy: Logistic Regression: 96%, Na√Øve Bias: 99.54%, K-Nearest Neighbour: 95.55%, Decision Tree: 98.86%, Random Forest: 98.86, Bagging: 98.63, Ada Boost: 80%. The second model is Yield Prediction System which predict the production of different crops (in tons) per year. Dataset consist of crop yield data of 101 different countries having parameters: Country_name, Crop, Year, Avg_rainfall, Pesticides_tonnes, Avg_temp etc. Advanced Machine Learning algorithms such as Decision tree, Random forests, Lasso regression, and Support vector machine are applied, giving combined accuracy of 98%. This research offers unparalleled recommendation and predictive accuracy and actionable insights. Without such an advanced system, farmers face inefficiencies, erratic yields, and unsustainable resource management, hindering their ability to meet the growing demand for food production. These experimental results demonstrate a marked improvement in prediction accuracy compared to traditional methods, showcasing the hybrid model's transformative potential. This robust softwarebased solution also addresses challenges like data heterogeneity and computational scalability, ensuring its applicability across various agricultural contexts. Embracing this technology signifies a leap towards intelligent farming, where quality, efficiency, productivity, sustainability, and resilience are at the forefront. The implications for the agricultural industry are profound, offering farmers and stakeholders the tools to revolutionize food production and ensure a sustainable future.
